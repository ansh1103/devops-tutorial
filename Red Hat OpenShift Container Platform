##OpenShift Container Platform 4 Architecture

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 (RHOCP 4) is a set of modular components and services built on top of Red Hat CoreOS and Kubernetes. 
OpenShift adds platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities such as remote management, increased security, monitoring and auditing, application life-cycle management,
and self-service interfaces for developers. It provides orchestration services and simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

An OpenShift cluster can be managed the same way as any other Kubernetes cluster, but it can also be managed using the management tools provided by OpenShift,
such as the command-line interface or the web console. This additional tooling allows for more productive workflows and makes everyday tasks much more manageable.

One of the main advantages of using OpenShift is that it uses several nodes to ensure the resiliency and scalability of its managed applications.
OpenShift forms a cluster of node servers that run containers and are centrally managed by a set of master servers. 
A single host can act as both a master and a node, but typically you should segregate those roles for increased stability and high-availability.

##Deploying an Application to an OpenShift Cluster
OpenShift manages an application life cycle using the Source-to-Image (S2I) process. S2I takes application source code from a Git repository,
combines it with a base container image, builds the source, and creates a container image with the application ready to run.

>> `oc new-app` command : The oc new-app command takes, in its simplest form, a single URL argument that points to either a Git repository or a container image.
It accesses the URL to determine how to interpret the argument and perform either a build or a deployment.
Example: oc new-app http://gitserver.example.com/mygitrepo
